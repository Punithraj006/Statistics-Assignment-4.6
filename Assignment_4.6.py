Problem Statement: 4.6

Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn
containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls. Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes.


Solution:
    
   Total ways can be = 10 ∗ 3
   
   
you pick one ball after another. There a three ways:

rbb
brb
bbr

Each of them have the probability of:

4/10⋅6/9⋅5/8

And in total 3⋅4/10⋅6/9⋅5/8
